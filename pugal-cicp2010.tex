\begin{abstract}
We are concerned with a model of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) materials
that consists of a coupled system of the Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations, 
discretized by means of the finite element method (FEM). We show that due to the 
transient character of the problem it is efficient to use adaptive algorithms 
that are capable of changing the mesh dynamically in time. We also show 
that due to large qualitative and quantitative differences between the 
two solution components, it is efficient to approximate them on different 
meshes using a novel adaptive multimesh \emph{hp}-FEM. The study is 
accompanied with numerous computations and comparisons of the adaptive 
multimesh \emph{hp}-FEM with several other adaptive FEM algorithms.
